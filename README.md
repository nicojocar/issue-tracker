### Note
Since there was no exact list of libreries to be used I've used the smallest amount of them in order to be able to write a clean and neat code. react and react-dom were absolutly necessary, semantic-ui-css and semantic-ui-react were used as noted in the React-Homework document and I also added react-scripts to be able to use JSX and all the power of React and ES6.
